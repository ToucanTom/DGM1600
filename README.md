If statements are essentially checks for specific conditions. if the condition is met then the incased code will run.
for example:
      if(x == 5){
          Begin();
      }
      In the above example the if statement checks to see if the variable "x" has a value of 5. If x is not equal to 5 then the block of code inside of the if statement will not run. If x is equal to 5 then the Begin function will be called.
      
     In some cases it is nessesary for if statements to have an additional "else" statement. This has many applications. One of which is to act as a failsafe. Say you have two different options for you program and you only want one block or the other one to run. you could set that up like this
     if( x==5){
          Begin();
     }else{
          x++;
     }
     In this case if x does not equal 5 not only will the program skip the first block of code, but the second block of code (x++;) will run. 
     
     other examples include:
     if (the sun is up){
     go outside;
     }else{
     stay inside;
     }
     or 
     
     if (there is lightning){
     close the pool;
     }else{
     open the pool;
     }
     
     
     (im not sure if this is what the assignment was wanting but please let me know what I can do if this isnt correct)
